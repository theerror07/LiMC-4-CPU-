Input Sequencer:                                    *DONE*
Uses to start each CPU machine cycle
Fetch, Incrament, Execute

IO buffer / register:                               *DONE*
Used to store values from RAM to CPU, has 2 parts
Opcode buffer (5 bits) CANNOT BE ACCESSED FROM DECODER / MICROCODE
Operand buffer (11 bits) can be accesed from decoder / microcode 

Program counter:                                    *DONE*
11 bits wide, containes 2 PCs. 
PC1 used for standard operation
PC2 used for load / store commands
can switch bteween both using commands from decoded

ALU:                                                *DONE*
Used to do mathmatical operations in the CPU

multi purpose registers:                            *DONE - PART OF ALU*
X, Y, Accumulator
Used in tandem with ALU
can hold 1 4 bit value each

Flag register:                                      *DONE*
holds status flags from ALU

Sub registers:                                      *DONE*
used to save current register values during a jump to sub command

decoder:                                            *DONE*
pulls Opcodes from Opcode Buffer, and runs it until a STOP bit is triggered
controlles the entire CPU

start stop:                                         *DONE*
controls if the CPU is running
